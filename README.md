# Timeline

This app gets entries from a Notion database, and displays them as a timeline.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Notion Database by duplicating [Timeline Template](https://decorous-course-27d.notion.site/9383ec0971b84bf39c1ae4f5e1a1c7fd?v=ddb9ed88aa5245f4a37a9cc417979196)
2. Create an integration with Notion by following instructions in [Notion API Docs](https://developers.notion.com/docs).
3. Get your **Notion Key** and **Database ID**.
4. Use `.env.example` to create `.env.local`.
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
